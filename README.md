# Fun with Triangles Web App

Welcome to the Fun with Triangles web app! This app allows you to learn and play with different properties of triangles.

## Installation

To use this app, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/santajitpatra/learn-triangles.git
```

Then, open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to start using the app.

## Features

The Fun with Triangles web app includes the following features:

- **Triangle Solver**: Enter the measurements of a triangle and the app will calculate its area, perimeter, and type (scalene, isosceles, or equilateral).
- **Quiz**: Test your knowledge of triangles with a multiple-choice quiz. The quiz covers topics such as types of triangles, Pythagorean theorem, and trigonometry.
- **Check Hypotenuse**: Enter the measurements of two legs of a right triangle and the app will calculate the length of the hypotenuse.
- **Check Angles**: Enter the measurements of three angles of a triangle and the app will tell you if they form a valid triangle and if the triangle is acute, obtuse, or right.

## How it Works

The Fun with Triangles web app uses basic geometry formulas to solve triangle problems and generate quiz questions. The app also uses JavaScript to handle user inputs and display results.
